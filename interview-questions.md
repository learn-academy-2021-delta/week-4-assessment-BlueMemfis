# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.  

1. What are props in React? 

  Your Answer: React allows us to pass information to a Component using something called props (stands for properties). Props are basically kind of global variable or object. this.props

  Researched answer: 
Props can be passed to a compontent and be an accessor.Once we have passed it we can access it at any point. They can also be passed to a  function-bassed compontent. But they will be accepted as parameters and can be accessed directly.


2. What is a DOM event? Your answer: DOM event occurr by user interactions or the browser. Mouse moving over an image and it changes, or just a web page loading. These events are done in JavaScript, Java or other languages.

  Researched answer:  Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects; that way, programming languages can interact with the page.



3. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

  Your answer: OOP is that we use objects to model real world things that we want to represent inside our programs, and/or provide a simple way to access functionality that would otherwise be hard or impossible to make use of.

  Researched answer:
  In Functional programming, data cannot be stored in objects. In OOP, data is stored in objects...
  It takes more memory to execute with functional and it requires a new object to execute every time.



4. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

  Your answer: float is a decimal. Integer is a whole number.

  Researched answer: float stores floating-point values, that is, values that have potential decimal places
int only stores integral values, that is, whole numbers



5. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

  Your answer: Ruby having an implicit return means that it's will return the last expression.You didnâ€™t explicitly state you want to return, but it still happening, so it implicit. Meaning we can write implicit return statements.

  Researched answer: when return isn't explicitly called within a method then Ruby returns the value of the last executed instruction in the method. In the implicit_return method, as if true is always evaluated as true then the last executed instruction is 99. So the method logically returns 99.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Instance Variable: variable which is declared in a class but outside of constructors, methods, or blocks.

2. PostgreSQL:  open-source, relational database management system (RDBMS) available for all major platforms including Linux, UNIX, Windows and OS X. 

3. Ruby on Rails: open-source software used to build web applications

4. ORM: It means you don't have to manually call the database yourself; the ORM handles it for you. Ruby on Rails uses one called ActiveRecord, and it's a really good one. 

5. Active Record:  ORM...provide an interface and binding between the tables in a relational database and the Ruby program code that manipulates database records.
